# Homework: Create a 235 home page

## I. Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 235 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the projects you will complete for this course.

## II. Requirements
* The page will be named index.html
* The page will be located at `http://people.rit.edu/yourid/235/`

Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 235 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask) -- funny we wrote that long before COVID, but we'd still like to see the real "maskless" you.
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragraph will do), telling us about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to each of the 3 class projects.
  - You do not need to create links to your past homework exercises, but you are welcome to do so if you wish.
* A link to your GitHub repo for this class
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout.
  - Try to consider at least some of the principles described in this chapter of a book about presentation design: [The Big Four: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf).  We will revisit these concepts & other design principles in a week or so.
  - We expect you to use the CSS Box Model and positioning to apply basic layout to your page, however, if you read ahead, you may also use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid techniques to improve your layout.
* You should use an *external CSS* file for all of your styles.
  - Your CSS should include at least 2 ID selectors and 2 class selectors
* You must also change all the anchors (links) on your page to match your color scheme (changing all five states)
* Your page needs to pass validation on [Validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) and the W3C [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
