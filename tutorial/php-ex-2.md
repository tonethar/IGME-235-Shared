# Exercise: PHP ICE 2

## Associative Array Practice

### Do this now:

Create a page named **php-ice-2.php** that does the following:
    1. Loops through this array - `$colors = ["red","green","blue"];` - and creates an HTML *ordered list* (the &lt;ol> and &lt;li> tags) that displays the contents of the array.
    2. Loops through the `$links` associative array in *[php-arrays-6.php](php-3.md#section5)* - and uses the key and value to create an HTML *unordered list* of clickable hypertext links.

    The HTML page will look something like this when you are done:

    ![Screenshot](_images/php-arrays-1.jpg)

    4. Post a copy of that file on banjo and confirm that it works.  (Only one post needed per group)
    5. Store the file for later bulk submission in your PHP-ICE Group's Shared Locker on myCourses.

### If you have time and didn't already do it this way:
    - Write your code in such a way that only one `echo` statement is required.
